					In the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programs for UNICEF, re-telling children’s stories of war. In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF. On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organization.

				<h3>1988-1989</h3>
				
				<p>
					Hepburn’s first field mission for UNICEF was to Ethiopia in 1988. She visited an orphanage in Mek’ele that house 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food. Of the trip, she said, “I have a broken heart. I feel desperate. I can’t stand the idea that two million people are in imminent danger of starving to death, many of them children, [and] not because there isn’t tons of food sitting in the northern port of Shoa. It can’t be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling on the the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die. Horrible. That image is too much for me. The ‘Third World’ is a term I don't like very much, because we’re all one world. I want people to know that the largest part of humanity is suffering.”
				</p>

					In August 1988, Hepburn went to Turkey on an immunization campaign. She called Turkey “the loveliest example” of UNICEF’s capabilities. Of the trip, she said, “The army gave us their trucks, the fishmongers gave their wagons for the vaccines, and once the date was set it took ten days to vaccinate the whole country. Not bad.” In October, Hepburn went to South America. Of her experiences in Venezuela and Ecuador, Hepburn told the United States Congress, “I saw tiny mountain communities, slums, and shantytowns receive water systems for the first time by some miracle - and the miracle is UNICEF. I watched boys build their own schoolhouse with bricks and cement provided by UNICEF.”
				</p> 

				<p>
					Hepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and met with leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders as part of a mission called “Operation Lifeline.” Because of civil war, food from aid agencies had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to souther Sudan. Hepburn said, “I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution - peace” In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, “Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her - she was like the Pied Piper.”
				</p>

				<h3>1990-1992</h3> 

				<p>
					In October 1990, Hepburn went to Vietnam, in an effort to collaborate with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunization and clean water programs. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it “apocalyptic,” she said, “I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this - so much worse than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn’t prepared for this.” Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. “Taking care of children has nothing to do with politics. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicalization of humanitarian aid, there will be a humanization of politics.”
				</p>

				<h3>Recognition</h3>

				<p>
					Present George H. W. Bush presented Hepburn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work with UNICEF, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences posthumously awarded her the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her contribution to humanity.
