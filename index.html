					Audrey Hepburn was born on May 4, 1929 in Ixelles, Brussels, Belgium.
				</p>


				<p>
					Hepburn’s mother, Baroness Ella van Heemstra, was a Dutch noblewoman. Ella Married Jonkheer Hendrik Gustaff Adolf Qualres van Ulfford, and they had two sons, Jonkheer Arnoud Robert Alexander Qualres van Ulfford and Jonkheer Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ulfford, before divorcing. Audrey’s father was Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston. He was a British subject who was born in Auschitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary. He married Ella in September 1926.
				</p>

				<p>
					Audrey’s father worked for tin merchants MacLaine, Watson and Company in London and then Brussels. Her father’s job required him to travel extensively. As a result of her multinational background and traveling with her family due to her father’s job, Audrey learned five languages: Dutch and English from her parents, and later, varying degrees of French, Spanish, and Italian.
				</p>

				<p>
					Hepburn’s parents officially divorced in June 1939, and Hepburn’s mother moved her daughter  to Arnhem, Netherlands with the hope that the Netherlands would be neutral and be spared a German attack. However, this was not to be, and the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940.
				</p>

				<p>
					Audrey’s family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Audrey later that “had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves. We thought it might be over nest week... six months... next year... that’s how we got through.” In 1942 her uncle was executed in retaliation for an act of sabotage by the resistance movement; while he had not been involved in the act, he was targeted due to his family’s prominence in Dutch society. Hepburn’s half-brother Ian was deported to Berlin to work in a German labor camp, and her other half-brother Alex went into hiding to avoid the same fate.
				</p>

				<p>
					Around that time Audrey, who had previously taken ballet lessons, performed silent dance performances in order to raise money for the Dutch resistance effort.
				</p>

				<p>
					Living conditions continually grew worse during the war, and Audrey’s family resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits. She developed acute anemia, respiratory problems and edema as a result of malnutrition.
